# HyperZip - Banner Archive Optimization Tool

HyperZip is a desktop application for optimizing and compressing banner folders to meet size requirements. It uses minification for HTML/CSS/JS and image compression via TinyPNG to reduce file sizes, then archives the optimized files using your preferred archiver.

## Troubleshooting & Recommendations

### For Best Performance

1. **Run as Administrator**: Running HyperZip with administrator privileges helps prevent file access issues, especially when working with system-protected directories.

2. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily**: Some antivirus software may interfere with file operations, particularly when creating and deleting temporary folders. Consider temporarily disabling your antivirus during processing.

3. **Correct Archiver Paths**: Ensure you've set the correct paths to your archiver executables:
   - WinRAR: Usually `C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe`
   - 7-Zip: Usually `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe`
   - ZPAQ: Path to where you've installed the ZPAQ executable

4. **Temporary Folder Issues**: If you encounter problems with temporary folders not being deleted:
   - Restart the application
   - Ensure no other programs are accessing files in the project directory
   - Run as administrator
   - Manually delete any folders ending with `_temp` if they persist

5. **TinyPNG API Key**: For image compression to work, you need a valid TinyPNG API key. Get one for free at [TinyPNG Developer API](https://tinypng.com/developers).

6. **Processing Large Projects**: When processing large projects:
   - Close other memory-intensive applications
   - Ensure you have sufficient disk space for temporary files
   - Be patient during processing, as image optimization can take time

7. **Windows 11 Specific**: On Windows 11, if you encounter issues with temporary folders not being deleted:
   - Run as administrator
   - Disable any file monitoring software temporarily
   - Ensure Windows Defender is not blocking the application
