Banner Archive Optimization Tool
HyperZip is a desktop application that optimizes and compresses folders to meet size requirements. It reduces file sizes by using minification for HTML/CSS/JS and image compression via TinyPNG, then archives the optimized files using your preferred archiver.

## Troubleshooting & Recommendations

### For Best Performance

- 7z-zip profile is recommended for minimum zip file size.
- Run as Administrator: Running HyperZip with administrator privileges helps prevent file access issues, especially when working with system-protected directories.
- Disable Antivirus Temporarily: Some antivirus software may interfere with file operations, particularly when creating and deleting temporary folders. Consider temporarily disabling your antivirus during processing.
- Correct Archiver Paths: Ensure you've set the correct paths to your archiver executables:
  - WinRAR: Usually C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe WinRAR Official Site
  - 7-Zip: Usually C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe 7-Zip Official Site
  - ZPAQ: Path to where you've installed the ZPAQ executable ZPAQ Official Site
- Temporary Folder Issues: If you encounter problems with temporary folders not being deleted:
  - Restart the application
  - Ensure no other programs are accessing files in the project directory
  - Run as administrator
  - Manually delete any folders ending with _temp if they persist
- TinyPNG API Key: For image compression to work, you need a valid TinyPNG API key. Get one for free at TinyPNG Developer API.
- Processing Large Projects: When processing large projects:
  - Close other memory-intensive applications
  - Ensure you have sufficient disk space for temporary files
  - Be patient during processing, as image optimization can take time
- Windows 11 Specific: On Windows 11, if you encounter issues with temporary folders not being deleted:
  - Run as administrator
  - Disable any file monitoring software temporarily
  - Ensure Windows Defender is not blocking the application
